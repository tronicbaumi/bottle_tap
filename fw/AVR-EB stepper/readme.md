## Full-Ramp

<br><img src="../images/stepper_symbol.png">
<br>Bipolar Stepper Motor

<br>This example presents a bipolar stepper drive with acceleration and deceleration ramps.

<br>The bipolar stepper motor will be driven in three modes:

## Full-Step Mode
<br>In Full-Step mode, the motor rotates complete mechanical steps at once - for a standard 200 full-steps/revolution stepper motor, this would be 1.8 degrees for a sub-step. The motor's two coils are powered sequentially in four full-steps. The sequence determines the stepper motor's direction of rotation. Full-Step mode is simple to control, but can cause vibration and noise due to the larger step angle. Another drawback of using this mode is that the stepper motor's current consumption is at the highest level, having the lowest efficiency. This mode is often used in applications where the drive algorithm simplicity is more important than the smoothness of operation or precision.

## Half-Step Mode
<br>In Half-Step mode, four extra steps are inserted between the four initial full-steps, which makes the stepper motor rotate by half of its full-step angle. This effectively doubles the number of mechanical steps per revolution - for a standard 200 full-steps/revolution stepper motor, this would be 0.9 degrees for a complete step, resulting in a smoother operation and less vibration compared to the Full-Step mode. 
<br>The benefits of having a balance between simplicity, efficiency, smoothness of operation
and a lower current consumption outweigh the increased complexity of the control algorithm needed for this
mode. It also provides double resolution of the Full-Step mode.


## Microstep Mode
<br>The Microstep mode divides the full-step angle into even smaller steps, providing even smoother operation and higher precision. The number of microsteps per full-step can vary, but common values are 8, 16, 32, or even 256 microsteps per full-step. Even though this mode requires the most complex control algorithms, the current consumption is lower than in Full-Step and Half-Step modes, providing the highest precision, the least vibration and less noise. Microstep mode is often used in applications where precision and smoothness of operation are paramount, such as in CNC machines.

## Functionality

<br>**Caution:** Do not change voltage during the stepper movement. The application assumes the supply voltage is stable.
<br>The supply voltage is checked and current adjusted only before movement.

<br>The application is periodically calling the ```Stepper_Move``` function with the parameters:
initial position, steps (to go), acceleration, deceleration, speed and vbus (bus voltage). In this implementation, the application automatically adjusts the drive amplitude according the the power supply voltage, trying to keep the current constant through the coils.

<br>The function precalculates the acceleration and deceleration time based on the speed and the number of steps the end-user wants the motor to move. 
After the computation is finished, the ```StepAdvance``` function is called, which controls the movement of the motor. The stepper drive schema is controlled by the ```StepAdvance``` function. ```StepAdvance``` is generating a wave 90 electrical degrees shifted.

<br>After movement completion, the ```Stepper_Move``` returns the final position.
<br>The drive is updated at every Pulse-width modulation (PWM) cycle, once every 50 µs. 

<br>Depending on the number of steps requested and the acceleration/deceleration values, the motor mmay reach the desired speed limit (figure 1) or not (figure 2). If the distance to reach the speed is too small, the motor will accelerate and then start decelerating without reaching the limit speed.

### Full-Step
<br><img src="../images/full_step.png">
<br>Ideal waveforms of the current that flows through the coils. Each full-step represents a stepper motor mechanical movement of 1.8 degrees.

<br>Full-Step: four full-steps sequence
<br><img src="../images/full_step_sequence_table.png">

<br>For a better aproximation, we are inserting intermediary steps, called half-steps.
### Half-Step
<br><img src="../images/half_step.png">
<br>Ideal waveforms of the current that flows through the coils. Each half-step represents a stepper motor mechanical movement of 0.9 degrees.

<br>Note: 0.707 represents sin(45 degrees) or cos(45 degrees).

## Microstep
<br>To obtain a smoother movement and better positioning, the driving waveform is an approximation of a sinewave.
<br>In the current implementation, the 1.8 degrees precision of the full-step are divided by 32 microstep, resulting in a microstepping precision of less than 0.06 degrees.

## Configuration

<br>**Note**: for a standard 200 full-steps/revolution stepper motor 1.8 mechanical degrees represent 360 electrical degrees (360 electrical degrees/200-steps is 1.8 mechanical degrees).

<br>The motor parameters can be configured in ```stepper.h```. The parameters that can be configured are the mechanical full-step angle and the mode in which the stepper should move (Full-Step, Half-Step or Microstep).

<br>The ```STEP_SIZE``` parameter is fixed and it represents the step angle of the stepper used in Full-Step mode. For this application, a stepper motor with 200 steps/mechanical revolution is used. 360 mechanical degrees/revolution divided by 200 steps results in 1.8 mechanical degrees/step.

<br>The ```R``` parameter is fixed and it represents the motor windings resistance, expressed in [ohm].
<br>The ```I_OUT``` parameter is fixed and it represents the motor peak current expressed in [mA]
<br>The ```KV``` parameter is fixed and it represents the BEMF current compensation. At higher speed, the BEMF increases significantly and needs to be compensated, in order to maintain a constant torque, by proportionally increasing the drive amplitude.

<br>The application contains an option that allows the stepper coils to still remain energized after the steper motor has finished the movement. The user can enable or disable this functionality with the help of the ```RELEASE_IN_IDLE``` flag.
<br>The flag is by default ```true```, which means that after every movement the current through the coils is stopped. If the user needs the coils to remain energized while the motor is idle, the ```RELEASE_IN_IDLE``` flag must be set to ```false```.

<br>To change the stepping mode, uncomment the corresponding macro in ```stepper.h```.

<br>Sub-step division:
<br>1 full-step = reference
<br>1 half-step = 1/2 full-step
<br>1 microstep = 1/32 full-step

<br>The ```CheckSteps``` function is called by the ```Stepper_Move``` function. The function is needed to provide variable length delay inversely proportional to the momentary speed of the stepper motor. It is using a fractional computation to avoid divisions.
<br>```time_flag``` is a shared boolean variable which is set by the Timer/Counter type E (TCE) interrupt, every 50 microseconds.
